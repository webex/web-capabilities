// PressureObserver is a W3C standard API that provides information about the system's pressure state.
// It allows web applications to observe the pressure state of the system, which can help them adapt
// their behavior based on the system's performance and resource availability.
// Pressure API is supported in modern browsers, but it is not available in all environments.
// Currently, it's not supported by TypeScript, so we need to define the types ourselves.
// NOTE: Consider removing this once TypeScript supports PressureObserver.

// https://w3c.github.io/compute-pressure/#pressure-states
// âšª Nominal: Work is minimal and the system is running on lower clock speed to preserve power.
//
// ðŸŸ¢ Fair: The system is doing fine, everything is smooth and it can take on additional work without issues.
//
// ðŸŸ¡ Serious: There is some serious pressure on the system, but it is sustainable and the system is doing well,
//              but it is getting close to its limits:
//
// Clock speed (depending on AC or DC power) is consistently high
// Thermals are high but system can handle it
// At this point, if you add more work the system may move into critical.
//
// ðŸ”´ Critical: The system is now about to reach its limits, but it hasnâ€™t reached the limit yet.
//               Critical doesnâ€™t mean that the system is being actively throttled,
//               but this state is not sustainable for the long run and might result in throttling if the workload remains the same.
//               This signal is the last call for the web application to lighten its workload.
